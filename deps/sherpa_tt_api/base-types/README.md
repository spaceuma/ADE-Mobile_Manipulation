This package holds the C++ definition of base types for the [Robot Construction
Kit](http://rock-robotics.org). It is maintained by the Rock core maintainers,
and aim at defining types that are generally useful for robotic applications.

While one can build it manually, it can also be built and installed using Rock's
[installation instructions](http://rock-robotics.org/stable/documentation/installation.html).

If the relevant dependencies (mainly Rice and Ruby itself) are installed, Ruby
bindings for some of these types are available. They are also made available
in Ruby [through Rock's toolchain](http://rock-robotics.org/stable/documentation/runtime/ruby_and_types.html) if Rock's [base/orogen/types](http://rock-robotics.org/stable/pkg/base/orogen/types/index.html) package is installed.
