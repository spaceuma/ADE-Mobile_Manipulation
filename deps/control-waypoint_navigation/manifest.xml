    <description brief="waypoint navigation library">
        This library implements a pure-pursuit based path following for
        rovers with Ackermann-type steering. 
        The path is represented as a list of waypoints, each
        consecutive pair interconnected using a straight line segments.
        The output is in form of translational and rotational velocity.
